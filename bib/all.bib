  abstract = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

In this paper the consequences of essential requirements of scale, perturbation and permutation invariance, together with that of subcompositional dominance, are applied to the problem of characterizing change and measures of difference between two compositions. It will be shown that one strongly advocated scalar measure of difference fails these tests of logical necessity, and that one particular form of scalar measure of difference (the sum of the squares of all possible logratio differences in the components of the two compositions), although not unique, emerges as the simplest and most tractable satisfying the criteria.},

  abstract = {Water chemistry is commonly investigated to determine the suitability of water for various uses. With increased knowledge of aqueous chemistry, it has become possible to interpret the evolutionary processes that determine water composition and quality. This paper presents procedures for exploring and modeling the environment using compositional data from water analysis, utilizing statistical tools in an appropriate sample space. Our procedures build on a methodology based on log-ratios initiated by John Aitchison in the early 1980’s. They are not only useful for interpreting the structure of the data, but also for characterizing and modeling the influence of geochemical processes acting on the environment. The geochemistry of water samples collected from wells on Vulcano Island (one of the Aeolian Islands of the Italian province of Sicily) will be used to illustrate the techniques, although an exhaustive overview would require many different examples. Vulcano island is a quiescent volcanic area where mobilization of chemical species by weathering of volcanic rocks and input of gaseous components from fumarolic activity has produced environmental changes expressed in the composition of phreatic waters at the surface and in the shallow subsurface. Changes in the chemical composition of waters in unconfined aquifers of the northwestern part of the island around the active crater appear to be useful in understanding the natural processes at work.},

  abstract = {Geochemical data are typically reported as compositions, in the form of some proportions such as weight percents, parts per million, etc., subject to a constant sum (e.g. 100\%, 1,000,000 ppm). This latter implies that such data are “closed”; that is, for a composition of D-components, only D − 1 components are required. The statistical analysis of compositional data has been a major issue for more than 100 years. The problem of spurious correlation, introduced by Karl Pearson in 1897, affects all data measuring parts of some whole, which are by definition, constrained; and such type of measurements are present in all fields of geochemical research. The use of the logratio transform was introduced by John Aitchison to overcome these constraints by opening the data into the real number space, within which standard statistical methods can be applied. However, many statisticians and users of statistics in the field of geochemistry are unaware of the problems affecting compositional data, as well as solutions that overcome these problems. A look into the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases shows that most papers where compositional data are the core of a geochemical research continue to ignore methods to correctly manage constrained data. A key question is how we can demonstrate that the interpretation of the behaviour of chemical species in natural environment and in geochemical processes is improved when the compositional constraint of geochemical data is taken into account through the use of new methods. In order to achieve this aim, this special issue of the Journal of Geochemical Exploration focuses on the correct statistical analysis of compositional data. Applications in exploration, monitoring and environments by considering several geological matrices are presented and discussed illustrating that several paths can be followed to understand how geochemical processes work.},

  abstract = {Groundwaters, like other natural waters, are solutions of a variety of substances in the solvent water. Human impact upon groundwater systems has created many environmental problems so that hydrogeochemical studies related to pollution have become very important. In this context high abundance of nitrogen species, particularly nitrates, can cause adverse health effects, their main sources being fertilizer, animal or human waste, natural soil organic matter, nitrogen fixation and rain. Graphical representations of hydrogeochemical data (for example molar ratio diagrams, stochiometric diagrams, triangular diagrams, mixing diagrams) pose considerable problems if statistical evaluations have to be performed. In fact, since hydrochemical data are compositional (proportional data), their sample space is the simplex, a constrained space where the application of the standard geometrical approach may provide misleading information. In this paper classical binary diagrams used to investigate the whole chemistry of water as well as the behaviour of nitrogen species were substituted by new equivalent graphs coherent with the properties of compositional data, thus opening new perspectives in the evaluation of geochemical processes affecting water resources. Moreover, since nitrogen species are often affected by the presence of numerous data below the detection limit, their role was investigated by considering different imputation methods, and evaluating their performance in the sub-composition NH4+, NO2−, NO3−. The first phase of the analysis did not consider the presence of data below the detection limit but subsequently, step by step, the possibility to recuperate this type of information was explored. The opportunity to recover information about data below the detection limit from the variance–covariance structure of the whole composition (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, HCO3−, Cl−and SO42− and available nitrogen data) was also investigated by considering a multivariate framework. The approaches, coherent with compositional data analysis theory, pointed out interesting aspects of 1) the relationships in the sub-composition of NH4+, NO2−, and NO3−, giving us a different perception of the background level of these species as well as of their source; 2) the effects on the variance–covariance structure of the whole composition (main anions and cations and nitrogen species); and 3) the loss of information about the covariance between chemical variables (coherence of geochemical behaviour), which is able to affect the understanding of geochemical systems.},

  abstract = {Geometry in the simplex has been developed in the last 15 years mainly based on the contributions due to J. Aitchison. The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

  abstract = {Amalgamation of parts of a composition has been extensively used as a technique of analysis to achieve reduced dimension, as was discussed during the CoDaWork’03 meeting (Girona, Spain, 2003). It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.},

  abstract = {The use of orthonormal coordinates in the simplex and, particularly, balance coordinates, has suggested the use of a dendrogram for the exploratory analysis of compositional data. The dendrogram is based on a sequential binary partition of a compositional vector into groups of parts. At each step of a partition, one group of parts is divided into two new groups, and a balancing axis in the simplex between both groups is defined. The set of balancing axes constitutes an orthonormal basis, and the projections of the sample on them are orthogonal coordinates. They can be represented in a dendrogram-like graph showing: (a) the way of grouping parts of the compositional vector; (b) the explanatory role of each subcomposition generated in the partition process; (c) the decomposition of the total variance into balance components associated with each binary partition; (d) a box-plot of each balance. This representation is useful to help the interpretation of balance coordinates; to identify which are the most explanatory coordinates; and to describe the whole sample in a single diagram independently of the number of parts of the sample.},

The clustering procedure partitions the field samples for the entire survey area into two clusters. The field samples in each cluster are partitioned again to create two subclusters, and so on. This manual procedure generates a hierarchy of clusters, and the different levels of the hierarchy show geochemical and geological processes occurring at different spatial scales. Although there are many different clustering methods, we use Bayesian finite mixture modeling with two probability distributions, which yields two clusters. The model parameters are estimated with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior probability density function, which usually has multiple modes. Each mode has its own set of model parameters; each set is checked to ensure that it is consistent both with the data and with independent geologic knowledge. The set of model parameters that is most consistent with the independent geologic knowledge is selected for detailed interpretation and partitioning of the field samples.},

  abstract = {Compositional data analysis (CoDa) of sedimentary basin brines can help reveal the hydrogeochemical history of hydrocarbon producing formations. CoDa uses log-ratio transformations to convert compositional data into Euclidean space, a necessary assumption for many mathematical models and basic data interpretation. This paper demonstrates the novel approach of pairing CoDa with thermodynamic geochemical models for bivariate and multivariate subcompositions for a suite of brines within three producing formations from the Permian Basin, USA. Subcompositional analysis of basin brines using [Na, Cl, H2O] and [Ca, SO4, H2O] with corresponding equilibration models, plotted using isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformations, shows reaction with anhydrite and halite at depth. The [Na, Cl, Br] subcomposition often can discriminate between seawater evaporation and halite dissolution; the sparse Br data suggest that both processes occur. Principal component analysis (PCA) of centered log-ratio (clr) data is useful for visualizing combinations of processes that are not readily apparent in the twosolute models. PCA of the Permian Basin brines reveals distinct groups of data, including samples likely affected by water flooding, and others influenced by a combination of Late Permian seawater evaporation or halite dissolution coupled with Ca + Mg ion exchange for Na on clays. These relationships support a hydrogeologic model in which meteoric inflow occurs in a heterogeneous manner much more complicated than the previously suggested concept of west-to-east piston style flow.},

  abstract = {The Devonian/Carboniferous (D/C) boundary is a critical interval in the Phanerozoic history, which is associated with vigorous climatic perturbations, continental glaciation, global sea-level fall and rapidly increased extinction rates in marine realms. In many sections world-wide, these global changes left a marked lithological signature, in particular the Hangenberg black shale (products of deep-shelf anoxia) and the overlying Hangenberg sandstone (sudden siliciclastic influx into predominantly carbonate depositional environments). Both layers bear a distinct geochemical signature. Even though either or both of these two lithologies are absent at many sections, their correlative counterparts can be indicated by subtle geochemical markers. We studied elemental geochemistry of fourteen D/C boundary sections in six key areas across Europe with the aim to select globally correlatable elemental proxy for the D/C boundary. Analysis of raw/log-transformed geochemical data (EDXRF, c.p.s. units), presenting the standard approach here, indicates that concentrations of terrigenous elements (Al, K, Rb, Ti and Zr) are mainly controlled by diluted Ca (carried by marine calcium carbonate) in limestone facies and, accordingly, their variations can be related to carbonate production in the sea rather than to terrigenous input from continent. Nevertheless, due to the relative nature of geochemical observations, reliance solely on statistical processing of raw data might lead to incomplete picture of multivariate data structure and/or biased interpretations. For this reason, the aim of this contribution is to discuss the logratio alternatives of the standard statistical methods, which may better reflect the relative nature of the data. For this purpose, principal component analysis was employed to reveal main geochemical patterns and while the geochemical signature of the D/C boundary was further analysed using Q-mode clustering that leads to predicative orthonormal logratio coordinates e balances. The comprehensive picture of the multivariate data structure provided by these statistical tools makes them a primary choice for exploratory compositional data analysis. At the same time, it turns out that the standard and compositional approaches have synergic effects. This fact can be extensively used in further geochemical studies.},

Using the method for raw data or for improperly transformed data will, however, lead to biased results and consequently to misleading interpretations. Although some procedures, suitable for factor analysis with compositional data, were already developed, they require pre-knowledge of variable groups, or are complicated to handle. We present an approach based on the centred logratio (clr) transformation that does not build on this pre-knowledge, but still recognizes the specific character of compositional data. In addition, by using the isometric logratio transformation it is possible to robustify factor analysis using a robust estimation of the covariance matrix. A back-transformation of the results to the clr space allows an interpretation of the results with compositional biplots. The method is demonstrated with data from the Kola project, a large ecogeochemical mapping project in northern Europe.},

Whenever the concentration of chemical elements is measured, the data will be closed, i.e. the relevant information is contained in the ratios between the variables rather than in the data values reported for the variables. Data closure has severe consequences for statistical data analysis. Most classical statistical methods are based on the usual Euclidean geometry — compositional data, however, do not plot into Euclidean space because they have their own geometry which is not linear but curved in the Euclidean sense. This has severe consequences for bivariate statistical analysis: correlation coefficients computed in the traditional way are likely to be misleading, and the information contained in scatterplots must be used and interpreted differently from sets of noncompositional data. As a solution, the ilr transformation applied to a variable pair can be used to display the relationship and to compute a measure of stability. This paper discusses how this measure is related to the usual correlation coefficient and how it can be used and interpreted. Moreover, recommendations are provided for how the scatterplot can still be used, and which alternatives exist for displaying the relationship between two variables.},

However, the term outlier is not uniformly defined across all these fields since the differentiation between regular and irregular behaviour is naturally embedded in the subject area under consideration. Generalized approaches for outlier identification have to be modified to allow the diligent search for potential outliers. Therefore, an overview of different techniques for multivariate outlier detection is presented within the scope of selected kinds of data frequently found in the field of geosciences. In particular, three common types of data in geological studies are explored: spatial, compositional and flat data. All of these formats motivate new outlier concepts, such as local outlyingness, where the spatial information of the data is used to define a neighbourhood structure. Another type are compositional data, which nicely illustrate the fact that some kinds of data require not only adaptations to standard outlier approaches, but also transformations of the data itself before conducting the outlier search. Finally, the very recently developed concept of cellwise outlyingness, typically used for high-dimensional data, allows one to identify atypical cells in a data matrix. In practice, the different data formats can be mixed, and it is demonstrated in various examples how to proceed in such situations.},

For this reason, standard statistical methods that rely on Euclidean structure of the real space cannot be used directly for statistical analysis. At first, compositional data need to be expressed in coordinates of an orthonormal basis on the simplex (with respect to the Aitchison geometry). The mathematical interpretation of the orthonormal coordinates is derived from the procedure by which they are constructed (called sequential binary partition), and they act as balances between groups of compositional parts. The goal of this paper is to describe the covariance structure of coordinates and, consequently, to provide a complementary interpretation based on log-ratios of parts of the original composition. It must be noted that, in a composition, the ratios themselves contain all the relevant information.

This study outlines the application of compositional data analysis (CoDa) to calibration of geochemical data and multivariate statistical modelling of geochemistry and grain-size data from a set of Holocene sedimentary cores from the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) delta. Over the last two decades, understanding near-continuous records of sedimentary sequences has required the use of core-scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, for both terrestrial and marine sedimentary sequences. Initial XRF data are generally unusable in ‘raw-format’, requiring data processing in order to remove instrument bias, as well as informed sequence interpretation. The applicability of these conventional calibration equations to core-scanning XRF data are further limited by the constraints posed by unknown measurement geometry and specimen homogeneity, as well as matrix effects. Logratio based calibration schemes have been developed and applied to clastic sedimentary sequences focusing mainly on energy dispersive-XRF (ED-XRF) core-scanning. This study has applied high resolution core-scanning XRF to Holocene sedimentary sequences from the tidal-dominated Indian Sundarbans, (Ganges-Brahmaputra delta plain). The Log-Ratio Calibration Equation (LRCE) was applied to a subset of core-scan and conventional ED-XRF data to quantify elemental composition. This provides a robust calibration scheme using reduced major axis regression of log-ratio transformed geochemical data. Through partial least squares (PLS) modelling of geochemical and grain-size data, it is possible to derive robust proxy information for the Sundarbans depositional environment. The application of these techniques to Holocene sedimentary data offers an improved methodological framework for unravelling Holocene sedimentation patterns.},

  abstract = {In the approach to compositional data analysis originated by John Aitchison, a set of linearly independent logratios (i.e., ratios of compositional parts, logarithmically transformed) explains all the variability in a compositional data set. Such a set of ratios can be represented by an acyclic connected graph of all the parts, with edges one less than the number of parts. There are many such candidate sets of ratios, each of which explains 100\% of the compositional logratio variance. A simple choice consists in using additive logratios, and it is demonstrated how to identify one set that can serve as a substitute for the original data set in the sense of best approximating the essential multivariate structure. When all pairwise ratios of parts are candidates for selection, a smaller set of ratios can be determined by automatic selection, but preferably assisted by expert knowledge, which explains as much variability as required to reveal the underlying structure of the data. Conventional univariate statistical summary measures as well as multivariate methods can be applied to these ratios. Such a selection of a small set of ratios also implies the choice of a subset of parts, that is, a subcomposition, which explains a maximum percentage of variance. This approach of ratio selection, designed to simplify the task of the practitioner, is illustrated on an archaeometric data set as well as three further data sets in an “Appendix”. Comparisons are also made with existing proposals for selecting variables in compositional data analysis.},

The treatment of lake sediment geochemical data within the compositional framework of logratio analysis and the corresponding use of principal component analysis, analysis of variance, linear discriminant analysis and spatial analysis with ordinary kriging provide an informative and quantitative manner for lithologic mapping. Principal component analysis provides useful information on the multi-element associations based on the contrast of rock types in the area. Supracrustal sedimentary rocks have a multi-element character that is distinctive from rocks derived from granitoid and gneissic rocks. The analysis of variance provides details on which elements are the best discriminators for differentiating between the rock types represented by the lake sediment geochemistry and the spatial analysis provides insight into the direction and spatial continuity of the elements associated with specific map units. Linear discriminant analysis provides a basis for distinguishing between the different map units and provides a method of validating the predictive capability of mapping the underlying map units based on the lake sediment geochemistry. The application of multivariate statistical methods on lake sediment geochemical data provides the basis for establishing an objective approach for discovering and classifying geochemical processes from which existing geological maps can be tested and validated and new geological maps can be made in areas where sufficient geological information is lacking.},

This paper aims to construct such orthonormal log ratio coordinates, called weighted pivot coordinates, that capture the relevant relative information about an original component and treat the redundant information in a controlled manner. Theoretical developments are supported by a thorough simulation study.

  abstract = {The unknown aetiology of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has attracted recent attention as a result of the increasing global prevalence and recent reviews of occupational and environmental exposure to nephrotoxins. The main focus of this research is to examine the potential relationship between environmental exposure to known nephrotoxins including arsenic, cadmium and lead and the potential health risk associated with the progressive dysfunction of the kidneys in renal impaired patients with CKD across Northern Ireland. In addition to these known nephrotoxins, co-abundance with several essential elements has been found to play a role as protecting mechanisms while others increase the uptake of nephrotoxic elements as a result of similar absorption mechanisms within the body. Key elements protecting the body from toxicity include selenium and zinc, whereas those which have been attributed to enhance the uptake of arsenic, cadmium and lead include iron and calcium. The compositional nature of the soil and stream geochemical data is explored to aid in the analysis of interactions between elements. Two approaches, one data-driven and the other knowledge-driven, are explored to investigate the associations between co-abundant elements. The bioaccessibility of these elements, which is the portion of the relevant toxin absorbed within the body, is also investigated to identify areas across Northern Ireland with an increased environmental hazard and potential health risk. The study uses a combination of datasets from the United Kingdom Renal Registry (UKRR) unknown aetiology subset, the soil and stream geochemical dataset from the Tellus Survey (GSNI) with the addition of a bioaccessibility subset. Findings suggest a relationship between the presence of elevated arsenic in stream waters and impaired renal function of the kidneys. Interactions between essential elements and potentially toxic elements could explain the regional variation of CKD of uncertain aetiology across Northern Ireland.},

Compositional data, carrying only relative information, require a different treatment in correlation analysis. For identifying the association between two compositional parts in terms of their dominance with respect to the other parts in the composition, symmetric balances are constructed, which capture all relative information in the form of aggregated logratios of both compositional parts of interest. The resulting coordinates have the form of logratios of individual parts to a (weighted) “average representative” of the other parts, and thus, they clearly indicate how the respective parts dominate in the composition on average. The balances form orthonormal coordinates, and thus, the standard correlation measures relying on the Euclidean geometry can be used to measure the association. Simulation studies provide deeper insight into the proposed approach, and allow for comparisons with alternative measures. An application from geochemistry (Kola moss) indicates that correlations based on symmetric balances serve as a sensitive tool to reveal underlying geochemical processes.},

The number of discreet impacts that occurred to form these melt droplets can be gleaned by compositionally analysing the droplets and establishing the number of distinct groups. Previous studies have inferred two, three, or more source impact events, although we believe the statistical techniques used to distinguish the groupings are open to criticism. Multivariate and univariate analysis (including discriminant analysis) of the majorelement composition of an increased data set of impact melt ejecta droplets have been performed. The results demonstrate that the uppermost ejecta layer is geochemically distinct from other late Eocene melt ejecta. Our statistical analysis suggests two underlying, purportedly stratigraphically separate ejecta layers, possess minimal differences that cannot be distinguished clearly from one another by discriminant analysis, which adds to the plausibility that they have a common source. Finally, our results reveal apparent disparities between the new major-element data from this study and data compiled from existing sources.},

The Quesnel Terrane hosts base and precious metal deposits; however, a ∼20,000 km2 area consisting of variably thick glacial overburden truncates surface exposure, likely masking buried deposits. Through a combined fuzzy logic and index overlay approach, geophysical, structural, and geochemical criteria were integrated into a prospectivity model. Three concealed porphyry Cu targets were identified in the tillcovered region and were validated by statistical analysis of lake and stream sediment geochemistry. The process of integrating various geoscientific disciplines and identification of targets has provided valuable insight for future exploration in covered regions. Moreover, the adopted approach leverages open-source public datasets, highlighting advantages of utilising such datasets for regional-scale exploration.},

These unobserved values hamper subsequent data analysis, and a number of procedures with different levels of sophistication have been introduced in order to deal with them. Unfortunately, those most commonly used in practice are those most prone to introduce bias and lead to poor estimates of the statistics of interest. We approach this topic in the context of geochemical compositional data, that is, data representing parts of a whole. Although the general statistical literature has provided well-based methods for censored data, which includes the case of nondetects, they have ignored the special nature of compositional samples. In this paper we review a number of methods introduced in the recent years to deal with values below the detection limit while meeting compositional principles. We provide guidance and computer routines to easily apply them in practice using the popular R statistical computing language.},

  abstract = {Present soil P cycling models and the related ecosystem services such as P retention deny the special properties of compositional data resulting from closure and leading to methodological inconsistencies and pathological behavior. Our objective was to elaborate and interpret a hierarchy of supervised balances between components of the soil P cycle computed as isometric log ratios (ilr) to avoid biases when assessing P risk in managed terrestrial ecosystems. Fourty-one acid sandy soils, 56 acid to neutral loamy to clayey soils and 41 acid organic soils (10 fibric or hemic peat and 31 sapric ‘moorsh’ or ‘muck’ materials) were collected in Québec, Canada, analyzed for resin-P, NaHCO3-P, NaOH-P and residual P fractions, arranged into a hierarchy of sound balances and classified for the risk of P leaching. Pathological behavior was shown by spurious correlations between P fractions varying in magnitude, sign and significance depending on what was considered as the “whole” (e.g. total P or soil dry matter). Discriminant analysis across unbiased balances showed that the balances related to soil genesis dominated P biogeochemistry. Soils at low or high P risk for P leaching showed contrasting degrees of Po and Pi loads. Low- and high-P risk loamy and clayey soils differed significantly for balances relating labile to slowly available Pi, as well as those relating Pi to Po. Lowand high-P risk sandy soils were contrasted by the balance relating oxalate-extractable Al and Fe. Peat and ‘moorsh’ materials differed in most ilrs. As soils loose ecosystem services provided by soil P geochemical and biological pools in terms of P-fractions balances, terrestrial ecosystems become less sustainable.},

  abstract = {Compositional data are those which contain only relative information. They are parts of some whole. In most cases they are recorded as closed data, i.e. data summing to a constant, such as 100\% - whole-rock geochemical data being classic examples. Compositional data have important and particular properties that preclude the application of standard statistical techniques on such data in raw form. Standard techniques are designed to be used with data that are free to range from -oo to +oo. Compositional data are always positive and range only from 0 to 100, or any other constant, when given in closed form. If one component increases, others must, perforce, decrease, whether or not there is a genetic link between these components. This means that the results of standard statistical analysis of the relationships between raw components or parts in a compositional dataset are clouded by spurious effects. Although such analyses may give apparently interpretable results, they are, at best, approximations and need to be treated with considerable circumspection. The methods outlined in this volume are based on the premise that it is the relative variation of components which is of interest, rather than absolute variation. Log-ratios of components provide the natural means of studying compositional data. In this contribution the basic terms and operations are introduced using simple numerical examples to illustrate their computation and to familiarize the reader with their use.},

  abstract = {A large regional geochemical data set of C-horizon podzol samples from a 188,000 km2 area in the European Arctic, analysed for more than 50 elements, was used to test the influence of different variants of factor analysis on the results extracted. Due to the nature of regional geochemical data (neither normal nor log-normal, strongly skewed, often multimodal data distributions), the simplest methods of factor analysis with the least statistical assumptions perform best. As a result of this test it can generally be suggested to use principal factor analysis with an orthogonal rotation for such data. Selecting the number of factors to extract is difficult, however, the scree plot provides some useful help. For the test data, a low number of extracted factors gave the most informative results. Deleting or adding just 1 element in the input matrix can drastically change the results of factor analysis. Given that selection of elements is often rather based on availability of analytical packages (or detection limits) than on geochemical reasoning this is a disturbing result. Factor analysis revealed the most interesting data structures when a low number of variables were entered. A graphical presentation of the loadings and a simple, automated mapping technique allows extraction of the most interesting results of different factor analyses in one glance. Results presented here underline the importance of careful univariate data analysis prior to entering factor analysis. Outliers should be removed from the dataset and different populations present in the data should be treated separately. Factor analysis can be used to explore a large data set for hidden multivariate data structures. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Applied geochemistry and environmental sciences invariably deal with compositional data. Classically, the original or log-transformed absolute element concentrations are studied. However, compositional data do not vary independently, and a concentration based approach to data analysis can lead to faulty conclusions. For this reason a better statistical approach was introduced in the 1980s, exclusively based on relative information. Because the difference between the two methods should be most pronounced in large-scale, and therefore highly variable, datasets, here a new dataset of agricultural soils, covering all of Europe (5.6 million km2) at an average sampling density of 1 site/2500 km2, is used to demonstrate and compare both approaches. Absolute element concentrations are certainly of interest in a variety of applications and can be provided in tabulations or concentration maps. Maps for the opened data (ratios to other elements) provide more specific additional information. For compositional data XY plots for raw or log-transformed data should only be used with care in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) sense, to detect unusual data behaviour, candidate subgroups of samples, or to compare pre-defined groups of samples. Correlation analysis and the Euclidean distance are not mathematically meaningful concepts for this data type. Element relationships have to be investigated via a stability measure of the (log-)ratios of elements. Logratios are also the key ingredient for an appropriate multivariate analysis of compositional data.},

  abstract = {Most data in environmental sciences and geochemistry are compositional. Already the unit used to report the data (e.g., μg/l, mg/kg, wt\%) implies that the analytical results for each element are not free to vary independently of the other measured variables. This is often neglected in statistical analysis, where a simple log-transformation of the single variables is insufficient to put the data into an acceptable geometry. This is also important for bivariate data analysis and for correlation analysis, for which the data need to be appropriately log-ratio transformed. A new approach based on the isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation, leading to so-called symmetric coordinates, is presented here. Summarizing the correlations in a heat-map gives a powerful tool for bivariate data analysis. Here an application of the new method using a data set from a regional geochemical mapping project based on soil O and C horizon samples is demonstrated. Differences to ‘classical’ correlation analysis based on logtransformed data are highlighted. The fact that some expected strong positive correlations appear and remain unchanged even following a log-ratio transformation has probably led to the misconception that the special nature of compositional data can be ignored when working with trace elements. The example dataset is employed to demonstrate that using ‘classical’ correlation analysis and plotting XY diagrams, scatterplots, based on the original or simply log-transformed data can easily lead to severe misinterpretations of the relationships between elements.},

  abstract = {Dealing with spatially-dependent compositional databases (including proportions, data in percentages, concentrations etc) should pay heed to the mathematical properties of these kinds of data: a valid composition must have positive components whose sum is at most a constant (1, 100\% etc.). Generally speaking this is easily done by working on a set of log-ratios of components rather than using the raw data. To study the spatial variability of these databases it is best to estimate and model the lr-variograms, i.e. the set of variograms of all possible pairwise log-ratios of components in the composition. Such lr-variograms contain all the information necessary to deal with intrinsic stationary compositions and may be modelled with standard geostatistical tools such as the linear model of coregionalization. Moreover, the properties of the model can be studied and relationships inferred between components and possible processes linked to a given spatial scale. Finally, component-by-component interpolation and mapping is straightforward with existing kriging and simulation techniques: these tools and concepts should be applied to any set of invertible component log-ratios, i.e. log-ratio transformations, in such a way that the original composition can be recovered from the transformed data and vice versa.},

Geochemical potential mapping typically involves using a small set of elements to predict an anomalous presence of a mineral commodity related with them. In this context it is common to work with logarithmically transformed concentrations of elements. This contribution explores a compositionally compliant approach to potential mapping using geochemical evidences, in which the whole set of components is applied a log-ratio transformation before any potential mapping technique is used. In this way, candidate zones can be identified by its high value in a certain ratio of elements, implying that the important information is a contrast between two or more elements, and not an absolute concentration of one of them. Two different potential mapping techniques are used (a method equivalent to the Fisher rule, and a Poisson point process, both accounting for spatial dependence), with different results.},

This paper presents an exploratory analysis of one such complex data set, the Tellus geochemical soil survey of Northern Ireland (NI). This exploratory analysis is based on one of the most fundamental exploratory tools, principal component analysis (PCA) and its graphical representation as a biplot, albeit in several variations: the set of elements included (only major oxides vs. all observed elements), the prior transformation applied to the data (none, a standardization or a logratio transformation) and the way the covariance matrix between components is estimated (classical estimation vs. robust estimation). Results show that a log-ratio PCA (robust or classical) of all available elements is the most powerful exploratory setting, providing the following insights: the first two processes controlling the whole geochemical variation in NI soils are peat coverage and a contrast between “mafic” and “felsic” background lithologies; peat covered areas are detected as outliers by a robust analysis, and can be then filtered out if required for further modelling; and peat coverage intensity can be quantified with the \%Br in the subcomposition (Br, Rb, Ni).},

The main result is that multivariate geostatistical techniques can and should be performed on log-ratio scores, in which case the system data-variograms-cokriging/cosimulation is intrinsically consistent, delivering the same results regardless of which log-ratio transformation was used to represent them.

  abstract = {Geochemical data used in this paper to identify geochemical signatures associated with Fe mineralization in eastern Tianshan mineral district, China are compositional data. In order to eliminate the spurious relationships between compositions, isometric logratio (ilr) transformation is currently employed to deal with the closure effects. The opened geochemical data are further analyzed by principal component analysis. By backtransforming to the clr space, PCA results of ilr transformed data with geological meanings of their counterparts assist in recognition of spatial distributions of both intermediate-felsic igneous rocks and fault systems in the study area. In comparison with log-transformed geochemical data, the ilr transformed ones are theoretically reasonable to apply standard statistics. In addition, multivariate outliers are identified to investigate their associations with the formation of these two geological features. At the end, this paper suggests that the ilr transformation is necessary to be applied routinely before applying statistical treatments to raw geochemical data.},

  abstract = {Identifying felsic intrusions is an essential task in support of mineral exploration because the intrusions can be a source of energy and metals for magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization. In this paper, two models for mapping felsic intrusions are compared based on regional geochemical and geophysical data. Geochemical data as a type of compositional data which carry relative information should be preprocessed using log-ratio transformation. The first model, a factor ratio (F2/F1) model, was developed based on the chemical characteristics of the felsic intrusions, which are rich in K2O and high field strength elements (F2), but poor in Fe2O3 and compatible elements (F1). The second model, a hybrid model that combines principal component analysis and local singularity analysis, was based on the chemical and physical properties of the felsic intrusions. The results showed that (1) raw geochemical data should be processed using log-ratio transformation prior to multivariate data analysis to avoid spurious correlations between variables, and (2) the hybrid model performed better than the ratio of factors model for inferring felsic intrusions in the study area. The felsic intrusions mapped in this study provide information that can support further mineral exploration in the Dong Ujimqin FeeCu polymetallic district, Inner Mongolia, northern China.},

  abstract = {The refinement of Lange's plagioclase–liquid hygrometer/thermometer presented in this paper is based on quadratic log-contrast models for experiments with mixtures. Lange's plagioclase–liquid equilibrium thermodynamic model involves linear functions of components of magmatic liquid and crystalline plagioclase. Assuming a known temperature, the response water is given a liquid composition of a mixture of eight oxide components by mole fraction and a crystalline–plagioclase composition of a mixture of three components. On the one hand, Lange normalized eight major liquid-oxide contents in terms of mole fraction to make their sum equate to 1, introducing spurious correlations among those component proportions, and the same problem exists for the crystalline–plagioclase components. Such spurious correlations among or the data-sum constraints on those proportions may affect the accuracy of humidity or temperature predictions, and the log-contrast method or compositional data analysis can remove those spurious correlations effectively. On the other hand, from a mathematical perspective, Lange's plagioclase–liquid equilibrium thermodynamic model is oversimplified because the activity–composition relations for magmatic liquid and crystalline plagioclase are described only in linear functions of those components; the measurement errors for components and melt water require a least quadratic analytic approach. In our new model, which is a refinement of Lange's model that utilizes quadratic log contrast methods for experiments with mixtures, the standard error of the estimate (SEE) is ±0.156, wt.\%H2O and all liquid and crystalline–plagioclase compositions are fitted equally well. When the model is used as a thermometer, all measured temperatures are recovered equally well within an average of ±13 °C.},
